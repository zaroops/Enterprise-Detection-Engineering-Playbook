# Enterprise Detection Engineering Portfolio

This repository showcases structured Detection Engineering and Threat Hunting exercises using Windows Security and Sysmon logs. I wanted to create what is, essentially a guidebook, to understanding various log IDs, how to analyze each of these said events, how to detect potential security scenartios, and provide methodology for threate hunting within enterprise AD environments. Each deep dive, detection use case, and threat hunting methodology is designed to demonstrate SOC-ready skills, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and analytical thinking.

## Sections

1. **Windows Event Deep Dives** – Detailed breakdown of event IDs and Sysmon events.
2. **Detection Use Cases** – Scenario-based detection logic with SPL queries and investigation steps.
3. **Threat Hunting Writeups** – Hypothesis-driven hunting methodologies for enterprise AD environments.

## How to Use

- Each markdown file is standalone and cross-references other files where necessary.
- Use as a reference for learning, building detections, and preparing for SOC interviews.
